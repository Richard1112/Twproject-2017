 * This code is based partly on the workaround suggested at:

 * Chunking is always used on windows systems without regard to the CPU
 * architecture, the files being used are on a local drive or a mapped network
 * one, declared using UNC or not. Also, it is higly unlikely that a message
 * will be greater that 2GB, so there should be no problems using this facility.
